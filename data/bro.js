“How many?”
  
Two. One to change the lightbulb, one to chill and offer support, because that’s what bros do. They get each other’s back.
  
“Okay…” 
  
You don’t get it. That’s chill. But I’m sure we can agree on one thing, and that’s that bros like us can’t live without a bottle of Bud Light™ and American football.
  
“I guess so”
  
Now I wanna get to know you, so we can be bros. What’s your idea of a chill vacation? You a guy who wants to kick back on the beach with an aluminum bottle of Bud Light™?. Or are you a guy who wants to like, camp on a mountain, crack open a can and experience the crisp taste of Bud Light™?

  A fist projects from the monitor and hits you in the nose, leaving you bloody and confused.
      
  “Okay, bye bye now,” B.R.O. says.
      
  You hear the snapping of fingers, and everything goes dark. Are you dead? You’re not sure. You feel nothing, standing in the void for eternity.

  You hear the snapping of figures. You’re freezing, on a tiny ledge atop a giant mountain, struggling to breathe in the thin air.
  
  “Here’s that mountain you wanted.”
  
  You feel two hands on your back. They push you off the ledge. You fall to your death.
